Can you have the “Save” button in Settings result in some visual confirmation that things have been saved?  When I click on it nothing happens, so one's assumption then is likely going to be that nothing has been saved.
Can we improve the formatting of the text in the image below so it looks like two different columns, not like a single, incorrect sentence with inexplicably two slider options?
Can you please change the slider buttons for the consent form here in the same way you did so on the consent page in the survey itself?
